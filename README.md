# Website Features

Chicflix is a streaming service provider where users can watch all their favourite movies. The user is greeted with the most popular movie on the home page, below which they can see all the other popular, trending and upcoming movies in the form of an image slider. Clicking on a movie opens a popup which displays information like title, summary, user rating and a button to add it to favourites.  Opening the favourites page displays all the movies a user has liked along with a button to remove it as well. A user can also search for a movie by visiting the search option on the navigation bar.
